Description: This is a simple HTML file that shows my favorite cars. I made this as the first website which I made it
about my favortite thing which is cars. I liked this homework because I got to learn the basics of Html and I did the 
basic stuff for the css file.

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I’m <strong>Luka Metias</strong>, a student at UMass Lowell exploring web design and
        user interfaces. This site is my first GUI homework project. My goals are to practice clean,
        semantic HTML5, how to style with CSS, and write documentation that clearly
        explains what I did and why. I’m especially interested in accessibility, typography, and
        simple layouts that look good on phones and laptops. Outside of class, I enjoy small coding
        projects, reading about technology trends as well as new cars.
